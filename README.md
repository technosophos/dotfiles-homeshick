# My Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, such as they are.

They're rarely up to date. I'm a horrible shell scripter. And I mainly just
pilfer my VIM config from [adamreese](https://github.com/adamreese/dotfiles).

But they feel like home to me.

This uses [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick).
