=====================================================================
DESCRIPTION                            *drupal-snippets-description*

drupal-snippets provides a number of snippets for common Drupal
programming structures, including hooks (all 300+ core hooks from
Drupal 7), common utility functions, and common data structures 
such as menu items and FAPI form definitions.


=====================================================================
FEATURES                                   *drupal-snippets-features*

There are two triggers for every hook: a succinct trigger and a 
verbose trigger. The succinct trigger provides a minimal hook
implementation, while a verbose trigger provides a documented,
feature-rich hook implementation.

The succinct version is always of the form h_HOOK_NAME:

    h_block_view

The verbose version is always of the form hook_HOOK_NAME:

    hook_block_view

FAPI form definitions also have triggers. Here are a few example
FAPI triggers:

    fapi
    fapi_option
    fapi_value
    fapi_radios
    fapi_textarea

These generate (in order) a generic FAPI field, an option box,
a stored value field, a set of radio buttons, and a textarea.

All of the FAPI field types are represented, and the format of
each is fapi_FIELDTYPE.

Finally, there are a number of Drupal utility triggers built in:

   - dsm: expands to a drupal_set_message() call.
   - mi: expands to a menu item
   - block_item: expands to a block item
   - ddebug: dumps a variable directly into drupal_set_message()
   - jdebug: serializes an object and puts it into the browser's 
     Javascript console.
   - watchdog: generates a watchdog log message.

Other functions and triggers are added all the time.
